{#3-5} - This will return either 3 or 4 (picked randomly).

{ARND6} - This will return 6 randomly generated numbers or characters.

{CRND5} - This will return 5 randomly generated characters.

# Adding support for another drive
I've developed an easy-to-use way of adding support for a new drive, follow the instructions below to get started!

1. Compile the program and place the .exe in any folder you want.

2. In the same folder as the .exe, create a new folder called "Drives".

3. In the "Drives" folder that you've just created, create a new .txt document and name it whatever the part/model number the drive it will represent.

4. Use the following template and make sure to remove the arrows: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=HbhrhtCN

5. Launch the program and if you did everything correctly you're done!
